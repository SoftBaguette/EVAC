# What is EVAC?

EVAC stand for Evolutionary and Adaptive Computing. It is a course taken at the University of York.

##  Module aims
This module introduces a range of biologically-inspired approaches to computing. It provides a foundation of both theoretical and practical knowledge on the subject of evolutionary computation, an optimisation technique inspired by biological evolution. Students will have hands-on experience implementing a number of types of evolutionary algorithms using Python and the library DEAP: Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python, to solve a range of different types of problems. The module also studies the use of Agents and Multi-agent Systems as a modelling paradigm, with a focus on evolutionary adaptation and learning.

## Module learning outcomes
- Use biological knowledge to inspire the development of natural computation approaches

- Design and implement systems in DEAP to address a complex problem, and critically evaluate the performance of their system

- Use a range of evolutionary algorithms, and understand their biological underpinnings.

- Understand and modify an existing rule-based multi-agent system;

- Define a range of agent behaviours and represent them in a form that is well suited to machine learning/selection

- Apply a selected range of advanced evolutionary algorithms and machine learning techniques in the context of the intelligent (learning, evolving) agent paradigm

- Evaluate the performance and implementation of multi agent systems
